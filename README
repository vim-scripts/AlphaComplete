DESCRIPTION
The built-in insert mode completion i_CTRL-N searches for keywords. When you
want to complete from fragments of variables (e.g. "frobnicator" from
"m_frobnicator"), it won't work. Same when you have a keyword prefix before
your completion base (e.g. "_fro" won't find "frobnicator").
This plugin offers completion of sequences of alphabetic characters ([A-Za-z],
/\a), and therefore can complete from text fragments or when there are
non-alphabetic keyword characters in front of the completion base.

SEE ALSO
- Check out the CompleteHelper.vim plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

USAGE
In insert mode, invoke the alphabetic completion via CTRL-X a
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.

CTRL-X a                Find matches for whole fragments of alphabetic
                        characters.
                        Further use of CTRL-X a will copy the text including
                        the next alphabetic fragments following the previous
                        expansion in other contexts.
